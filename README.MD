**Script write Lightroom face data and tags to image metadata using ExifTool**


*This script is intended for educational purposes only. Use at your own risk.*

*It is recommended to backup your Lightroom catalog and images before running this script.*

*This script is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied.*

Based on the database schema from: ***Lightroom Classic 14.3*** analyzed as *SQLite 3 Database*

  

The usage of python and ExifTool is needed as Lightroom does not write face data to metadata nor it provides a way to export it via Plugin API.
The script queries the database for all the files with Faces and extracts all the regions as defined in Lightroom, this is done in memory; it also queries all the metadata related to faces and their hierarchy.
For every file with faces it extracts the metadata (Subject, HirearchicalSubject, PersonInImage) from the image or the XMP sidecart .xmp file and compares the Face from database with the ones in metadata, it checks for the presence of a IPCT block to extract Keywords tag.
On the face the check to avoid duplicates is done on the name and on the region verifying there are not regions fully overlapping.
If the Face is not present in the file it is added to the XMP metadata. 
The metadata is checked for duplicates, based on name, and  will add the missing Face keywords accordingly.
The HierarchicalSubject is the full metadata hierarchy, separated by |.
The script manages flat metadata (as in .heic files) and hierarchical regions (as in .jpg files).
Highly optimized with threads for speed and memory, using a single exiftool subprocess per thread.
If executed without any flag a GUI is shown, as well as if requested from command line; at run configuration parameters are saved (Lightroom_Face_to_Metadata_last_run.json) and re loaded on next run as defaults for options not specified in the command line.

  

Options are:

    --catalog		            Path to Lightroom .lrcat file
    --log			            Path to save the log file - default log.txt in the same folder of the script
    --write			            Enable actual writing (default is dry-run)
    --exiftool-path                     Path to the exiftool executable - default is exiftool in the same folder of the script
    --log-level		            Set the logging level - default is 'INFO', choices are 'DEBUG', 'INFO', 'WARNING', 'ERROR', 'CRITICAL'
    --tags                              Write hierarchical keyword tags to metadata
    --profile                           Enable profiling and save output to specified file (default: profile.prof)
    --batch-size                        Database query batch size (default: 1000)'
    --threads                           Number of threads for file operations (0 = auto-detect optimal)
    --max-threads                       Maximum number of threads to use when auto-detecting (default: 16)
    --gui                               Shows the GUI

Usage Examples:


**Basic usage (dry run):**


    python optimized_script.py --catalog /path/to/catalog.lrcat

**Write mode with hierarchical keywords:**


    python optimized_script.py --catalog /path/to/catalog.lrcat --write --tags

**Performance tuning for large catalogs:**


    python optimized_script.py --catalog /path/to/catalog.lrcat --batch-size 2000 --write

**With profiling:**


    python optimized_script.py --catalog /path/to/catalog.lrcat --profile performance.prof
