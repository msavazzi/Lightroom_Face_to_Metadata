**Script to sync Lightroom face data to image metadata using ExifTool**

  

Based on the database schema from: ***Lightroom Classic 14.3*** analyzed as *SQLite 3 Database*

  

The usage of python and ExifTool is needed as Lightroom does not write face data to metadata nor it provides a way to export it via Plugin API

  

Options are:

    --catalog		Path to Lightroom .lrcat file
    --log			Path to save the log file - default log.txt in the same folder of the script
    --write			Enable actual writing (default is dry-run)
    --exiftool-path	Path to the exiftool executable - default is exiftool in the same folder of the script
    --log-level		Set the logging level - default is 'INFO', choices are 'DEBUG', 'INFO', 'WARNING', 'ERROR', 'CRITICAL'
